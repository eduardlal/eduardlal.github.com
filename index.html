The Xbox One X is the console of the future. Not only is it the most powerful gaming console on the planet that's publicly available right now, but it stands to hold that title for the rest of the console generation.

But before you break out the charts, tell us about the lack of exclusives or inundate us with emails about how PS4 Pro is just as good as a console (we agree, it is), we have to first face facts: Under its hood, the Xbox One X packs an eight-core CPU, clocked at 2.3GHz, alongside 12GB of GDDR5 RAM. It also features a GPU clocked at 1172MHz, which gives you a huge 6 teraflops of graphical computing power.
It is A LOT of processing power for a console. 

The reason the Xbox One X needs it, however, is because it plays some titles in native 4K resolution - and sometimes at 60 frames per second. It's capable of HDR playback for games in the HDR10 format and supports Dolby Vision video streaming,  too.

For AV fans, this is the only platform where you'll find a 4K Blu-ray player built into the box and support for Dolby Atmos, a more immersive audio format than 7.1 surround sound.

And yet, in spite of all of this, it's not perfect.

Its hard drive, which currently is locked at 1TB, fills up faster now that most games require 4K texture packs. Outside of Forza Horizon 4, State of Decay and Sea of Thieves, there were very few exclusives in 2018. And best/worst of all, you get a lot of the same functionality from the Xbox One S ... which sells for around half the cost.
All this isn’t said to shame the Microsoft fan base - in fact, for a certain type of gamer, the Xbox One X is still the greatest console ever made in spite of its limitations. It’s just that, for most folks, the One X imposes a premium tax on a system that’s only marginally better in most ways than the Xbox One S.  

The X can play games in native 4K while the S only does upscaled 4K, sure, but Xbox One S does upscaled 4K so well that you might not even be able to notice a difference between the two. And, even if you could, is it enough to warrant the $200/£200 gap in price? The answer, well ... it depends.
If you’ve seen an Xbox One S at some point, you should be able to picture the Xbox One X – if it weren’t for the difference in color schemes, the two consoles would be nearly identical. 

If you’ve never seen a One S before, the Xbox One X is a rectangular box the size of a large Blu-ray player that’s coated with a matte space grey color. It’s a far cry from the bulky VHS player-stylings of the original Xbox One, and the design only becomes more impressive when you consider what’s under the hood.

The noticeable differences here between Microsoft's last console and its latest one (if you can even notice them) are the color change from the white sheen of the Xbox One S to the space grey of Xbox One X, and the shifting of the disc tray from the top-left side of the console’s face to sitting discreetly lower down the front. 

These changes are aesthetic, however, and neither add nor take away any functionality from the system... which isn’t a bad thing considering how well-equipped the Xbox One S was.
